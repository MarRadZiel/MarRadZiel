Hi, I'm Marcin Zieliński.</br>
I'm interested in game development. 
Currently I'm coding mostly in C#/.NET and using Unity Game Engine but I've experience with XNA/MonoGame framework as well.
My favourite programming tasks are those which include creating tools helping in application development process such as creating or expanding game engine capabilities.
I take part in many game jams and contests. 

Here are a few projects that I've taken part in:
