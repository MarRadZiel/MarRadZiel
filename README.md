Hi, I'm Marcin Zieli≈Ñski.</br>
I'm interested in game development.</br>
Currently I'm coding mostly in C#/.NET and using Unity Game Engine but I've experience with XNA/MonoGame framework as well.</br>
My favourite programming tasks are those which include creating tools helping in application development process such as creating or expanding game engine capabilities.</br>
I also like taking part in game jams and contests.</br>
