Hi, I'm Marcin aka @MarRadZiel.</br>
I'm interested in game development. 
Currently I'm coding mostly in C# and using Unity Game Engine but I've experience with XNA/MonoGame framework as well.
My favourite programming tasks are those which include creating tools helping in application development process such as creating or expanding game engine capabilities.
I take part in many game jams and contests. 

Here are a few projects that I've taken part in:
- Witchcraft: https://blahray-studio.itch.io/witchcraft (custom engine based on XNA/Monogame framework)
